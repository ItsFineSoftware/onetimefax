<h1>How to Send a One-Time Fax</h1><p>Sending a one-time fax is a great way to get a document to someone quickly and easily. Faxing has many benefits over other methods of sending documents, such as email or postal mail. Faxes can be sent and received almost instantaneously, and they are less likely to be lost or stolen in transit. In addition, faxes can be sent to multiple recipients at the same time, which is not possible with email or postal mail.</p><p>There are some drawbacks to sending a one-time fax, however. First, you will need to have access to a fax machine or an online fax service. Second, you will need to know the recipient's fax number. Finally, you will need to pay for the cost of sending the fax, which can be significant if you are sending a large document.</p><h2 id=2>How to Prepare to Send a One-Time Fax</h2><p>Before you send a one-time fax, you will need to do some preparation. First, you will need to gather all of the documents that you want to send. Make sure that each document is clearly legible and that all of the pages are in the correct order. Next, you will need to find a fax machine or an online fax service. If you are using a fax machine, you will need to have the recipient's fax number. If you are using an online fax service, you will need to sign up for an account and add the recipient's fax number to your address book.</p><p>Once you have all of the necessary information and materials, you are ready to send your fax. If you are using a fax machine, simply insert the documents into the machine and dial the recipient's fax number.
